fable
===

`fable` is a port of [cucumber](http://cukes.info/) to php. It can use [SimpleTest](http://www.simpletest.org/)'s browser component to do interface testing.

It's currently quite sparse on features - mostly a proof of concept. It work fine though.

fable is an easy and story-driven approach to write high level automated tests (functional tests). It has a guide built in, that will offer you advise as you go along. Try it out now by running `fable` from the root of your project.
